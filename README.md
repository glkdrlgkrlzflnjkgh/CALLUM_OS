Welcome to the CallumOS offical repository!

CallumOS is an open source Operating System written in C, with a little bit of assembly.
(note: please ignore the boot.bin and stage2.bin files, theyre assembled binaries of the broken custom bootloader CallumOS was PLANNED to use but I changed it to use GRUB!)
